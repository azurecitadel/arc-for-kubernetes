# Azure Arc for Kubernetes

This repository contains useful resources for provisioning Azure resources, Kubernetes clusters and applications

You will create a child repository from this template and use it as a basis of your work.

The contents are divided into two halves, firstly the unmanaged cluster set up that will provision between 1..n Kubernetes clusters

You can read more about how this is done by following the instructions here:

* [Create unmanaged clusters](00-setup)

Later when you have the clusters set up and connected to Azure you will want to deploy a real application to them. In order to achieve this there are a number of scripts and templates organised for running. More details can be seen here:

* [Deploy application resources](01-app-setup)
